* COMMON FOR:  Data File Module.
*=====================================================================
* MODIFICATION HISTORY:
*    920618:  Changed MXDSFLNM from 50 to 80.
*    920501:  Added kecmem to control memory save/delete on readerr.
*    920410:  Bugfix, had character variables in cmdfm common.
*             Should have been in kmdfm. Not a problem on the SUN,
*             but the IBM RISC 6000 fortran compiler version 1.3
*             got it's text space all screwed up.
*    920402:  Bugfix, changed incds to dimension mdfl.
*    911015:  Added nflncds array, count of files in each data-set.
*    910828:  Made ncdsndx an array and added ncdscnt and mcdscnt
*             to allow multiple (up to mcdscnt) current data-sets.
*    910809:  Added data structures for multiple Data Sets.
*               Copies of primary storage structures/variables are:
*                 ndsxdta, ndslndta, ndsxhdr, ndslnhdr, ndscomp
*               New structures/variables are:
*                 kdsname, kdsnm, kpdsnm, ndsndx, ncdsndx, 
*                 mdsnmcnt, ndsflcnt, kdsflnm, incds, lnewds, 
*                 kdsdfl, nkdflkup
*
*    870625:  Added datagen and default read and write directories.
*    860918:  Changed to character lists for data file list storage.
*    850415:  Major restructuring due to new memory manager.
*    830927:  Moved XLIM rtw variables to GAM common block.
*    820830:  Restructured to conform to FORTRAN 77 specifications.
*    820818:  Moved file id variables from GEM to here.
*    820806:  Changed WRFMT to LWRSAC.  Added LOVRRQ.
*    820623:  Changed format for storing x limits.
*    810723:  Remove CMMEM to separate insert file.

      common /cmdfm/ ndfl, idflc
      common /cmdfm/ linmem, lrqmem, imemry, iinmem, ibuffr

* - Parameters used for data sets
*   mdsl:     Maximum number of defined data sets.
*             IF CHANGING THIS... SEE DATA STATEMENT IN setcdsindeces.f
*   mcdscnt:  Maximum number of allowed current data-sets.

*   mxdsflnm: Maximum length of a file name.
*   mkdflkup: NOT USED -- YET. See nkdflkup.
      parameter (mdsl=13, mcdscnt=13, mlnkdsnm=32, mxdsflnm=80) 
*     parameter (mkdflkup=100)

* - Variables used for data sets.
*   kdsname:  Array of names of the data sets
*   kdsnm:    Requested data set
*   kpdsnm:   Name of previously requested data set.
*   ndsndx:   Index of which data set in kdsname the file belongs to
*   ncdsndx:  Indices of current data sets in kdsname
*   ncdscnt:  Number of current data-sets
*   ndsnmcnt: Maximum position in kdsname to searched to when 
*             locating, adding or deleting a data set.
*
*   ndsflcnt: Maximum position in the data set storage to search to
*             when inserting, locating or deleting files.
*   nflncds:  Count of the number of files in each data-set.
*             Added 10/15/91 to make fft handle multiple data-sets.
*   kdsflnm   Names of files in memory - as an array.
*   incds:    Flag for a file belonging to the current data set.
*             The position in the data set. Set to a negative value
*             when the data set is currently active.
*   ldschg:   Logical flag set TRUE if changing to previous data set.
*   kdsdfl:   Names of the files in memory - as a character list.
*               Not being used yet.
*               
*   nkdflkup: Not being used yet. Intended for position and count, in 
*               the kdsdfl character list of names for files associated 
*               with a data set.
*               First position would indicate how many times a read more
*               has been performed in the data set. Subsequent pairs
*               would be: number (space-delimited word) of the
*               first file name in the list and the number of 
*               subsequent file names for each read operation.
*               The book-keeping started to sound awful, so I just stuff
*               file names into the kdsflnm array.
