                              ANNOUNCEMENT


                              PLEASE NOTE!


New data and user reports have revealed that observed PKPdf travel times in the
distance range 145 to 180 degrees are 2 to 3 seconds later than travel times
predicted by the iasp91 model. To correct this problem the velocity of the
inner core has to be reduced. A new model iasp91a has been produced in which 
the velocity in the inner core has been reduced by 0.12 km/s. This will give  
a shift in PKPdf which reaches 2.5s at 180 degrees.

To convert the old iasp91 model to the new iasp91a model a single change is
needed in the common block for P in the file emiasp91.f.

      data p/11.12094,10.03904,14.49470,25.1486 ,25.969838,29.38896,

Thence, rerun all the programs needed to produce tables for the user interface.

Only the df branch of core phases is affected by the change so that the IASP91
SEISMOLOGICAL TABLES remain useful for all other phases. A supplement to the
TABLES will be prepared to allow the correction of PKPdf if so desired.

We are also considering the publication of the revised tables for PKPdf with
the displays which led to the need for a change as a research note.

Further feedback on the iasp91 model from users is strongly encouraged!
